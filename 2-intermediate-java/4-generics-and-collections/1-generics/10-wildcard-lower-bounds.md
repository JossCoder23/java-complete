## Wildcard Lower Bounds

Recall that generic code can have an upper bound when defined using a type parameter or a wildcard. We can also provide a lower bound when working with wildcards. A lower bound wildcard restricts the wildcard to a class or interface and any of its parent types. For example:

```java
public class Util {
    public static void getBag(Bag<? super Integer> bag) {
        return bag;
    }
}
```

In the example above, we used the ```super``` keyword to restrict the argument to ```getBag()``` to be a ```Bag``` of ```Integer```, ```Number```, or ```Object```. If a call to ```getBag()``` with ```Bag<Double>``` is made, it would result in an error because ```Double``` is not an ```Integer``` or one of its parents.

Some important things to note about lower bounds are:

* They cannot be used with generic type parameters, only wildcards.
* A wildcard cannot have both a lower bound and an upper bound. In this case, it’s best to use a generic type parameter.

There are some general guidelines provided by Java as to when to use what type of wildcard:

* An upper bound wildcard should be used when the variable is being used to serve some type of data to our code.
* A lower bound wildcard should be used when the variable is receiving data and holding it for later use.
* When a variable that serves data is used and only uses ```Object``` methods, an unbounded wildcard is preferred.
* When a variable needs to serve data and store data for later use, a wildcard should not be used (use a type parameter instead).

Let’s practice adding a lower bound to a generic method.
