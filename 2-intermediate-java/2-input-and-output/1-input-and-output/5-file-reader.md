## FileReader

```FileReader``` and ```FileWriter``` are two of Java’s built-in input stream ```classes``` and can be extremely useful when your program is working with external files when those ```files``` contain text information. Both of these classes are specifically made to write character information to and from files.

As with ```Scanner```, we will need to import these classes in order to use them in our program. They both reside in the ```java.io``` package. Unlike with Scanner however, these classes throw a specific type of exception, an ```IOException```, if something goes wrong during the read/write process. This ```IOException``` also needs to be imported from the same package. We’ll dive into how exceptions work later in the lesson, for now we’ll add a line to our main method declaration that simply throws the ```IOException``` out of the program.

```java
public static void main (String[] args) throws IOException {}
```

Now, let’s take a look at how to implement a ```FileReader``` instance into our program to read text from a file.

**Step 1: Declare and initialize your FileReader.**

As with nearly all Java objects, we follow the pattern ```ObjectClass objectName = new ObjectClass();```
```java
FileReader reader = new FileReader(filePath);
```

You will notice here in the constructor that we are passing in a ```filePath```, this is a String that represents the path of the file to be read.

* An example of how an absolute path may look is ```FileReader input = new FileReader("C:/SampleFolder/input.txt")```
* An example of how a relative path may look is ```FileReader input = new FileReader("../documents/SampleFolder/input.txt")```

Alternatively, you may choose to create an object of the variable type ```File``` to pass into the ```FileReader```. This is useful if you plan to have the user pass in a path to the input file. The code block below shows an example of how you may do this.

```java
//Option 1: Pass file path/name directly to FileReader
FileReader input1 = new FileReader("input.txt");

// Option 2: Use File object to pass file info to FileReader
// Save file path that has been passed in by the user into a string variable.
String fileName = args[0];
// Pass path to File object
File inputFile = new File(fileName);
// Pass File object to FileReader
FileReader input2 = new FileReader(inputFile);
```

**Step 2: Read your file.**

Also much like ```Scanner```, ```FileReader``` has ```methods``` to validate content and read contents, these are ```.ready()``` and ```.read()```. The ```.ready()``` method makes sure that there is content to read and the ```.read()``` method reads the file one character at a time. The following code shows how to print each character in the file, which will effectively print the contents of the file as written.
```java
while (reader.ready()) {
    System.out.print((char) reader.read());
}
```

**Step 3: Wrapping Up Loose Ends**

It is critically important to close resources such as files and input streams. These can tie up memory on the processor and in some file systems only one asset can access a file at a time, essentially blocking all access to the file from other sources. These resources can either be manually closed like we will do here, or automatically closed with a ```try-with-resources``` block like we will implement in future exercises.

Closing ```FileReader``` also has the added benefit of ```flushing``` the stream as well, making sure that any information that is still in the ```FileReader```‘s buffer is written to the console.
```java
input.close();
```

**Input.txt**
```txt
My name is John Smith.
I am 27 years old.
My hobbies are reading, painting, and watching movies.
What is your name?
```

**Introduction.java**
```java
public class Introduction {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String path = "./input.txt";
    }
}
```

**EXERCISE:**

1. Before the ```Introduction``` class, import the ```FileReader``` and ```IOException``` classes from the the ```java.io``` package.

    In your main method declaration, indicate that this method may throw an ```IOException```.

    **SOLUTION:**
    
    **Introduction.java**
    ```java
    import java.io.FileReader;
    import java.io.IOException;

    public class Introduction {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
            String path = "./input.txt";
        }
    }
    ```

2. Declare a ```FileReader``` object using ```path```, which points to the relative path of input.txt. Name the ```FileReader``` something pertinent.

    **SOLUTION:**
    
    **Introduction.java**
    ```java
    import java.io.FileReader;
    import java.io.IOException;

    public class Introduction {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
            String path = "./input.txt";
            FileReader reader = new FileReader(path);
        }
    }
    ```

3. Now it’s time to access our file! To do so:

    * Create a ```data``` variable set to ```0```.

        * This will either contain ```-1``` (if the end of the file is reached) or the raw data of the next character which needs to be cast to a ```char```.
    
    * Write a ```while``` loop for reading all characters in the file.

        * This should use your ```FileReader``` object’s ```.read()``` method and continue until ```data``` is ```-1```.
        * Print out each character using ```System.out.print()``` and ```(char)data```.

    **SOLUTION:**
    
    **Introduction.java**
    ```java
    import java.io.FileReader;
    import java.io.IOException;

    public class Introduction {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
            String path = "./input.txt";
            FileReader reader = new FileReader(path);
            int data = 0;
            while((data = reader.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char)data);
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
4. Finally, close your ```FileReader``` object.

    **SOLUTION:**
    
    **Introduction.java**
    ```java
    import java.io.FileReader;
    import java.io.IOException;

    public class Introduction {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
            String path = "./input.txt";
            FileReader reader = new FileReader(path);
            int data = 0;
            while((data = reader.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char)data);
            }
            reader.close();
        }
    }
    ```
