## The Scanner Class

Just like ```System```, the ```Scanner``` class is predefined and built into Java for your use. It’s used to read ```user input``` in a Java program. When we declare a scanner we need to tell it what type of input we are going to be scanning, this gets passed into the constructor when we initialize it.

For this exercise, we will build a program that walks us through writing code using the ```Scanner``` class along with the input from the console, which we get from ```System.in```. The ```Scanner``` class comes with Java in the package ```java.util```, therefore before we can use the ```Scanner``` class in our own code we must import it from that package, which you can do using the following:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

**Note**: Everything that is contained in the ```java.lang``` package is automatically imported into every Java program. Every Java SDK installation comes with everything in the ```java.base``` module, a ```collection``` of resources that make Java what it is. The other packages contained in ```java.base``` such as ```java.util``` and ```java.io``` provide helper functionality that isn’t necessary to every program, but is used in special circumstances, such as when we need a ```Scanner```. We access these extra ```classes``` by importing them in our program. This tells the ```compiler``` to go to those packages and make sure the resource is available for use when we build our programs. So why don’t we include everything in all Java programs? If we did that, our programs would be huge when compiled, including many many ```files``` we will never use. Importing specific classes from these packages keeps our software lean and efficient.

Now that we have access to the Scanner class, let’s begin by declaring the ```Scanner``` class as an instance variable called ```input```:
```java
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
```

Notice how we have placed ```System.in``` within parenthesis in our declaration. This is what will allow our program to read user input from the console. Similar to how the ```out``` property of System was a ```PrintStream```, the ```in``` property is an instance of an ```InputStream```, read more about it ```here```.

The ```Scanner``` class can also read input from a file; we will cover that in a later exercise.

**Introduction.java**
```java
public class Introduction {
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        
    }
}
```

**EXERCISE:**
1. Import the ```Scanner``` class at the top of your program, outside of the class declaration.

    **SOLUTION:**
    ```java
    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Introduction {
        public static void main( String[] args ) {
            
        }
    }
    ```

2. Now declare and instantiate a new ```Scanner``` object using ```System.in``` in the constructor.

    **SOLUTION:**
    ```java
    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Introduction {
        public static void main( String[] args ) {
            Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        }
    }
    ```
