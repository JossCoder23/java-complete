## Serializable Fields

When serializing objects, we often need to handle static class fields or exclude non-static fields in the serialization. Recall that the JVM defines a default way of serializing objects; this default includes ignoring static class fields, which belong to a class and not an object. The JVM also serializes all fields in an object, even those marked ```private``` and ```final```.

Although the JVM implicitly serializes non-static fields, we can instruct the JVM to ignore them using the ```transient``` keyword. A field marked as ```transient``` will have its value ignored during serialization and instead receive the default value for that type of field.

Let’s visualize this with some code:
```java
public class Person implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private static int numberOfPeople = 10;
    private transient int yearBorn;  
} 
```

In the example above, we defined a ```static``` field called ```numberOfPeople``` with a value of ```10```. Since it belongs to the class, it will not be included in the serialization process. We also defined a ```transient``` field called ```yearBorn``` of type ```int```. The JVM will ignore the initialized value of this field and instead serialize the field with its default value for its type (0 in this case).

Let’s discuss some interesting aspects of deserializing objects with ```transient``` and ```static``` fields:

* The deserialized (copy) object will not get the default value for a ```static``` field (in our example the value ```0```). Since a ```static``` field belongs to the class and not the object, a deserialized ```static``` field will receive the value it corresponds to in the current class.
* A constructor is not called during deserialization for the deserialized type object. Object fields are set using reflection.
* A constructor is only called for the first non-serializable class in the parent hierarchy of the deserialized object.

We often want to serialize all non-static fields in an object. However, sometimes we may need to serialize ```transient``` fields if a field’s value is dependent on other fields or, more importantly, if we have a reference field that is not serializable (we’ll talk about this later).

Let’s practice using different types of serializable and non-serializable fields.

**Car.java**
```java
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Car implements Serializable {
  private String make;
  private int year;
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
  private String model;

  public Car(String make, int year, String model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.year = year;
    this.model = model;
  }

  public String toString(){
    return String.format("Car make is: %s, Car year is: %d, Car model is: %s, serialVersionUID: %d", this.make, this.year, this.model, serialVersionUID);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    Car toyota = new Car("Toyota", 2021, "Corolla");
    Car honda = new Car("Honda", 2020, "Civic");
    FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream("cars.txt");
    ObjectOutputStream objectOutputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(fileOutputStream);
    objectOutputStream.writeObject(toyota);
    objectOutputStream.writeObject(honda);

    FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("cars.txt");
    ObjectInputStream objectInputStream = new ObjectInputStream(fileInputStream);

    Car toyotaCopy = (Car) objectInputStream.readObject();
    Car hondaCopy = (Car) objectInputStream.readObject();

    boolean isSameObject = toyotaCopy == toyota;
    System.out.println("Toyota (Copy) - "+ toyotaCopy);
    System.out.println("Toyota (Original) - "+ toyota);
    System.out.println("Is same object: "+ isSameObject);
  }
}
```

**EXERCISE:**
1. Let’s practice the serialization process with ```static``` and ```transient``` fields.

    We’ve included a new ```String``` field named ```model``` in the ```Car``` class and modified the constructor and ```main()``` function to incorporate it. Run the program to observe what gets printed when deserializing an object with a non ```transient``` and ```static``` field.

    **SOLUTION:**

    OUTPUT:
    ```git
    Toyota (Copy) - Car make is: Toyota, Car year is: 2021, Car model is: Corolla, serialVersionUID: 1
    Toyota (Original) - Car make is: Toyota, Car year is: 2021, Car model is: Corolla, serialVersionUID: 1
    Is same object: false
    ```

2. Let’s see what happens when we serialize an object with a ```transient``` field.

    Modify the ```model``` field and include the ```transient``` keyword after ```private```. Observe the terminal output for ```toyotaCopy``` and it’s ```model``` field.

    **SOLUTION:**

    ```java
    import java.io.Serializable;
    import java.io.FileOutputStream;
    import java.io.FileInputStream;
    import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
    import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
    import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
    import java.io.IOException;

    public class Car implements Serializable {
        private String make;
        private int year;
        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
        private transient String model;

        public Car(String make, int year, String model) {
            this.make = make;
            this.year = year;
            this.model = model;
        }

        public String toString(){
            return String.format("Car make is: %s, Car year is: %d, Car model is: %s, serialVersionUID: %d", this.make, this.year, this.model, serialVersionUID);
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
            Car toyota = new Car("Toyota", 2021, "Corolla");
            Car honda = new Car("Honda", 2020, "Civic");
            FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream("cars.txt");
            ObjectOutputStream objectOutputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(fileOutputStream);
            objectOutputStream.writeObject(toyota);
            objectOutputStream.writeObject(honda);

            FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("cars.txt");
            ObjectInputStream objectInputStream = new ObjectInputStream(fileInputStream);

            Car toyotaCopy = (Car) objectInputStream.readObject();
            Car hondaCopy = (Car) objectInputStream.readObject();

            boolean isSameObject = toyotaCopy == toyota;
            System.out.println("Toyota (Copy) - "+ toyotaCopy);
            System.out.println("Toyota (Original) - "+ toyota);
            System.out.println("Is same object: "+ isSameObject);
        }
    }
    ```

    OUTPUT:
    ```git
    Toyota (Copy) - Car make is: Toyota, Car year is: 2021, Car model is: null, serialVersionUID: 1
    Toyota (Original) - Car make is: Toyota, Car year is: 2021, Car model is: Corolla, serialVersionUID: 1
    Is same object: false
    ```
